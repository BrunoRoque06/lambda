# OOP Limitations

This project showcases some of the conceptual limitations of object oriented programming languages. The high level take away is: objects are not reusable, interfaces are.

> I think that large objected-oriented programs struggle with increasing complexity as you build this large object graph of mutable objects. You know, trying to understand and keep in your mind what will happen when you call a method and what will the side effects be. - Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure
